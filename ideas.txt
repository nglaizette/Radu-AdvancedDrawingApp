Signal is cool but not yet natively supported in JS

​​JS has observer baked in via Proxy. It can help streamline binding and code further. JFYI.

ShapeView...Shape properties set via getter/setter methods when values set can choose to call updateView method , shapeView has ref to shapeData, properties panel has ref to current

​​I think you should invert the dependency of select tools containing the tools array.
 and instead define a shape factory that defines the shape, class, and tool. 
 select tools would use the factory to ​​find all shapes with tools
​​this would allow for shapes to be loaded without tools.

data driven binding is the way to go. looks good to me!
